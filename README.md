## Introduction

Traditional time series analysis methods often face challenges with complex patterns, long-range dependencies, and data scarcity. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable sequence modeling capabilities. This framework aims to adapt these capabilities for general time series analysis, drawing inspiration from the SeisMoLLM project which successfully applied a similar approach to seismic data.

The core idea is to transform time series data into a sequence of "feature tokens" suitable for LLM processing. This is achieved through a specialized front-end network (e.g., multi-scale convolutional embedding and latent patching). A pre-trained LLM (like GPT-2) then processes these tokens, and its parameters are fine-tuned efficiently (e.g., using LoRA) for the specific time series task. Task-specific output heads then generate the final predictions or analyses.

## Key Features

*   **Cross-Modal Transfer Learning**: Leverages the power of LLMs pre-trained on extensive text corpora for time series tasks.
*   **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Employs techniques like LoRA to adapt large pre-trained models with minimal trainable parameters, reducing computational costs and data requirements.
*   **Generic Front-End Design**: The convolutional embedding and latent patching mechanism can be adapted for various types of 1D time series data.
*   **Versatile Task Support**: Flexible output head design allows easy extension to various downstream tasks (forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, etc.).
*   **Potential for High Performance**: Aims to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance by harnessing LLM's deep understanding of sequences.

## Model Architecture

The framework generally consists of four key components:

1.  **Multi-Scale Convolutional Embedder**: Extracts local, fine-grained features from the raw time series and performs initial sequence compression. The multi-scale nature helps capture patterns Dependencies at different temporal resolutions.
2.  **Latent Patching**: Segments the feature sequence from the embedder into "patches." These patches are then rearranged and aggregated to form a sequence of fixed-dimensional "feature tokens" that serve as input to the LLM.
3.  **Pre-trained LLM Core**: Utilizes the Transformer blocks of a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA, or other suitable models). Most of the original LLM parameters are kept frozen. Fine-tuning is achieved through techniques like LoRA, and by making specific layers trainable (e.g., positional embeddings, layer normalization layers) to adapt to the new data modality.
4.  **Task-Specific Output Heads**: Decodes the features cinese from the LLM core into predictions cinese for the specific task. For forecasting, this might be a regression head; for classification, a classification head.

## Potential Applications

This framework can be adapted for a wide range of time series tasks, including but not limited to:

*   **Time Series Forecasting**:
    *   Stock price prediction
    *   Weather forecasting
    *   Energy load forecasting
    *   Ionospheric TEC forecasting
    *   Sales forecasting
*   **Time Series Classification**:
    *   Activity recognition from sensor data
    *   Medical signal classification (e.g., ECG, EEG)
*   **Anomaly Detection in Time Series**
*   **Analysis of Complex Scientific Data** (e.g., astronomical, geophysical, biological sequences)

## Installation

1.  **Clone Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/[YourRepositoryName].git
    cd [YourRepositoryName]
    ```

2.  **Create Conda Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    conda create -n ts_llm python=3.8  # Or your preferred environment name and Python version
    conda activate ts_llm
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    The exact dependencies will be based on the SeisMoLLM codebase. Key packages include:
    ```bash
    # Ensure you have a compatible PyTorch version for your CUDA setup
    # Example for CUDA 11.8:
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    pip install transformers peft einops pandas numpy h5py scikit-learn tensorboard matplotlib
    # If a requirements.txt is provided from the SeisMoLLM base:
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file (if available from the SeisMoLLM source you are basing this on) or the import statements in the Python scripts for a complete list.

## Dataset Preparation

Proper dataset preparation is crucial for training and evaluation.

*   **General Time Series Data**:
    *   Data should typically be in a format like CSV or HDF5.
    *   For CSVs, each row might represent a time step, and columns could represent different features or the target variable.
    *   Time series should be preprocessed (e.g., cleaned, missing values handled, normalized).
    *   Users will likely need to adapt the existing data loading scripts in the `datasets/` directory (e.g., `datasets/base.py` and potentially create a new `datasets/custom_timeseries_dataset.py`) to load their specific time series format.

*   **Configuration**:
    *   Parameters related to data, such as input sequence length (`in_samples`), sampling rate (if applicable), and feature dimensions, will need to be configured, likely in a central `config.py` file or passed as arguments to scripts.

## Usage

### Training a New Model

1.  **Configuration**:
    *   Adapt the main configuration file (e.g., `config.py` or a YAML file if you choose to use one) to specify:
        *   `model_name`: The specific model variant to use.
        *   `dataset_name`: Identifier for your custom dataset.
        *   `data_dir`: Path to your dataset.
        *   Training hyperparameters: `batch_size`, `epochs`, `learning_rate`, `optimizer_type`, etc.
        *   Model-specific parameters: `in_samples`, `patch_size`, `llm_layers`, LoRA configurations, etc.
        *   GPU settings: `gpu_id`, distributed training parameters.

2.  **Run Training Script**:
    *   The SeisMoLLM codebase provides example training scripts in `run_scripts/` (e.g., `train_stead.sh`). These can serve as templates.
    *   You will likely call a main Python script (e.g., `main.py` or `training/train.py` from SeisMoLLM).
    *   Example (conceptual):
        ```bash
        # Modify a script like train_stead.sh or create a new one
        # bash run_scripts/train_custom_timeseries.sh

        # Or directly:
        # python main.py --config path/to/your_timeseries_config.py --mode train
        ```

3.  **Outputs**:
    *   Training logs are typically printed to the console and saved in a `logs/` directory, structured by experiment name.
    *   TensorBoard logs for monitoring training progress will also be in the experiment's log directory.
    *   Model checkpoints (usually the one with the best validation performance) are saved under `logs/[experiment_name]/checkpoints/`.

### Making Predictions/Evaluation

1.  **Prepare Data and Model**:
    *   Ensure your test dataset is ready and formatted correctly.
    *   Have the path to your trained model checkpoint (`.pth` file).

2.  **Run Evaluation Script**:
    *   Adapt existing test scripts (e.g., `test_stead.sh` from `run_scripts/`) or the main Python script for evaluation mode.
    *   Example (conceptual):
        ```bash
        # bash run_scripts/test_custom_timeseries.sh --checkpoint_path path/to/your/model.pth

        # Or directly:
        # python main.py --config path/to/your_timeseries_config.py --mode test --checkpoint path/to/your/model.pth
        ```

3.  **Results**:
    *   Evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, F1-score, Accuracy, depending on the task) will be displayed and logged.
    *   Predictions might be saved to a file or visualized.
